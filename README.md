# ABSTRACT

**PURPOSE**  :	Internship training on “CONVEYOR MONITORING APPLICATION USING PYTHON”
**VENUE**	   :	Administrative Office, Mine-I, Neyveli.

The project focuses on the continuous monitoring of temperature and vibration in motors used in conveyor belts at a coal mine. The system collects real-time data, stores it in a MySQL database using XAMPP, and presents it through a user interface developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js. Key objectives include ensuring motor health, and facilitating timely maintenance. The technology stack includes Arduino for sensor data acquisition, NodeMCU for data transmission, and Node.js for database connectivity.

# I Developed My Skills in 
To create beautiful web designs with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, build powerful backend systems using Node.js, and manage data effectively with MySQL. These skills have empowered me to bring ideas to life in the digital world with creativity and precision.
